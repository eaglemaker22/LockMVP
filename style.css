/* Custom CSS for LockMVP Dashboard - Very minimal, Tailwind handles most styling */

/*
   If you had any specific fonts or base styles that aren't
   handled by Tailwind's defaults or your CDN links, they'd go here.
   For example, if you wanted a specific global line-height or text color
   that differs from Tailwind's defaults on the body.
*/

/*
   The previous custom CSS for .dashboard-container, .dashboard-column,
   .dashboard-section, etc., is largely replaced by Tailwind classes
   directly in the HTML.

   The border colors for the sections (the "bars under the title")
   are now controlled by classes like `border-blue-500`, `border-green-500`,
   `border-purple-500`, `border-red-500` directly on the <section> tags.

   The `last-updated` styling is handled by Tailwind classes like
   `text-sm text-gray-500` in the HTML.

/* You might need this if the empty table row for spacing gets a default border */
#mortgage-rates-section table tr.h-2 {
    border-bottom: none !important;
}

/* Optional: if you want more precise control over the inner table text */
#mortgage-rates-section table {
    /* You can add specific font-size here if `text-sm` on the parent div
       isn't enough or you need a slightly different size */
    /* font-size: 0.85rem; */ /* Example: slightly smaller than Tailwind's text-sm */
}

/* Optional: If you need to make the last row of the table explicitly no bottom border */
#mortgage-rates-section tbody tr:last-of-type td {
    border-bottom: none;
}
